 "You hide yourself in the pantry of the Kitchen, scared shitless you quickly lock the door." 
 "Covering your mouth with one hand, you hear thumping footsteps slowly dissipate from you."

 "{i}Oh my god, Cherry's dead, Klaus is a monster, What the hell is going on!{/i} " 

 "Your breath is labored, and your heart is beating against your ears. " 

 "Your adrenaline rocks you slowly back and forth, until a cold slimy sensation slides over your neck."

 "You carefully look up behind you to see the face of a bone dry corpse hanging from meat hooks." 

 "Your gaze falls onto the empty void of where eyes would be."

 "You stifle a scream, as tears well up in your eyes. The body is beyond recognition."

 "{i}I don't want to die... Please, God, I don't want to die just yet. Please let me live. Please let me live.{/i}"

 "You repeat this to yourself. Again. And again. And again. Clutching your own body as you curl up into a ball, keeping your eyes painfully shut. "

 "{i}I've been trapped in this eternal darkness for so long that time has lost meaning. God knows how long it's been since food ran out.{/i}"

 "{i} I hear the growling and thumping within the mansion every waking moment. I used to pray that it would never find me, but now I no longer have the strength to draw its attention to myself. I wished I died that day. I'm no different from the corpse rotting behind me.{/i}"

 "Soft footsteps begin approaching the door of the pantry. There's a metallic click from the handle of the door, slowly creaking open as blinding light shines down on my starved body. My sunken eyes water as a shadowed figure looms over me. "

 "{i}My time has finally come.{/i}"

 "{i}Joffrey?! What the hell is she talki-{/i}"

 "She begins pinching her nose"

 m  "For Joffrey to persist from before and for you to even still be here... there must be some special interaction between this space and the candidates?" 
 
 m"Intriguing. Well, you being alive is a rather interesting outcome however your overall performance still leaves much to be desired.  "

 "She sighs and cocks a revolver between your eyes."

 m  "See you soon."
