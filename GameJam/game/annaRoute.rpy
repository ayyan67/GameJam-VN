Annabelle, sits on the edge and lightly paddles her feet, making ripples in the water. I sit next to her and dip my feet in as well{/i}"

me"Y'know sitting by a glowing pool at night is kinda aesthetic."

a"I suppose you're right..."

me"Smells like rain. You think it's gonna rain?"

"{i}Holy shit this is awkward. Am I this socially inept? She seemed more chatty earlier…{/i}"

"Minutes pass by in silence"

a"m ...orry…"

me"Ah! Pardon?"

"{i}I barely heard her...{/i}"

a"I'm sorry… that was pretty awkward…"

me"Oh no! It's all good! I'm not that good at engaging in conversation myself…"

a"No, seriously… At this point… Any other person… would just make up some excuse to leave…"

me"…."

a"I don't blame them… I don't know why I'm like this…"

me"Hey, everyone's a little socially awkward at first! At least having a friend or two from school makes things easier."

a"I was homeschooled… so I never got to talk to anyone… and I've never had friends…"

"{i}Shit.{/i}"

me"Just how much have you been isolated?"

a"My mom… she left with another man when I was five… So it was only my dad who raised me…"

"{i}Jesus christ.{/i}"

a"He was scared… he was scared of me leaving him too… So he made sure I never talked to anyone…"

me"Do you resent your dad?"

a"N-No! Anything but that!"

a"I… He tutored me while working at a hospital… He's the reason why I got really good scores on the GED… He's the reason I got into a good university… I'm grateful for everything he's done… But…"

me"But?"

a"I don't know…"

"{i}She sits silently, deep in thought. Tears form at the corners of her eyes{/i}"

me"...Is everything okay?"

a"Oh… sorry, I just…remembered something painful…"

a"As much as I wished I lived a normal childhood… I just can't get angry at my dad… With him having to raise me under those conditions,  I want to do my best to repay him… I want him to retire comfortably…"


me"That's really admirable, not a lot of people think that way about their parents…"

a"I wanted to get a part-time job… But all he says is that I should stay in school… He says that he'll work extra hard to make sure we can get by…" 

a"That's why I came on this trip… $100,000 dollars after 3 days…" 

me"Yeah, that's too good of an opportunity to pass up." 

a"That’s why I came on this trip, I need that cash prize or dad will..."

me"As long as you stay in school, I'm sure everything will work out! You'll land that nursing position and live a good life. I'm sure that's what your dad would want too."

a  "I just don’t know what to do. I’m at my wits end. Even though I thought this trip was a scam I still came."

me "Don't sweat it. You gotta have hope! I’m down to give you the $45,000 for your dad’s operation if I win! The others may be willing to pitch in if they end up winning aswell!"

m "It seems that Chef suffered a laceration in this area as well. However, it is not as deep."

me "There's dried-up blood near his ears."

m "This frothy substance too-"

me "That’s his saliva. He probably started foaming in his mouth."
