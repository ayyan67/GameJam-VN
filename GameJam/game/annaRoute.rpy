"{i}It's a clear night sky but the slightly wet grass gives off the smell of fresh summer dew as if it's about to rain. 
Annabelle, sits on the edge and lightly paddles her feet, making ripples in the water. I sit next to her and dip my feet in as well{/i}"

me"Y'know sitting by a glowing pool at night is kinda aesthetic."

a"I suppose you're right..."

me"Smells like rain. You think it's gonna rain?"

a"I'm not sure…"

me"Yeah, me neither..."

"{i}Holy shit this is awkward. Am I this socially inept? She seemed more chatty earlier…{/i}"

"Minutes pass by in silence"

a"m ...orry…"

me"Ah! Pardon?"

"{i}I barely heard her...{/i}"

a"I'm sorry… that was pretty awkward…"

me"Oh no! It's all good! I'm not that good at engaging in conversation myself…"

a"No, seriously… At this point… Any other person… would just make up some excuse to leave…"

me"…."

a"I don't blame them… I don't know why I'm like this…"

me"Hey, everyone's a little socially awkward at first! At least having a friend or two from school makes things easier."

a"I was homeschooled… so I never got to talk to anyone… and I've never had friends…"

"{i}Shit.{/i}"

me"Just how much have you been isolated?"

a"My mom… she left with another man when I was five… So it was only my dad who raised me…"

"{i}Jesus christ.{/i}"

a"He was scared… he was scared of me leaving him too… So he made sure I never talked to anyone…"

me"Do you resent your dad?"

a"N-No! Anything but that!"

a"I… He tutored me while working at a hospital… He's the reason why I got really good scores on the GED… He's the reason I got into a good university… I'm grateful for everything he's done… But…"

me"But?"

a"I don't know…"

#show annabelle sad

"{i}She sits silently, deep in thought. Tears form at the corners of her eyes{/i}"

me"...Is everything okay?"

a"Oh… sorry, I just…remembered something painful…"

a"As much as I wished I lived a normal childhood… I just can't get angry at my dad… With him having to raise me under those conditions,  I want to do my best to repay him… I want him to retire comfortably…"


me"That's really admirable, not a lot of people think that way about their parents…"

a"I wanted to get a part-time job… But all he says is that I should stay in school… He says that he'll work extra hard to make sure we can get by…" 

a"That's why I came on this trip… $100,000 dollars after 3 days…" 

me"Yeah, that's too good of an opportunity to pass up." 

a"Yeah…" 

me"As long as you stay in school, I'm sure everything will work out! You'll land that nursing position and live a good life. I'm sure that's what your dad would want too."

#show anabelle happy

a"Thanks…" 

me"It's no problem"

a"No really… I've never told anyone about my family life… It just feels good getting this off my chest…" 

me"Don't worry, I can always lend an ear anytime!" 

a"Thank you so much." 

me"It's getting pretty late,  wanna head back upstairs?" 

a"Ah yes…" 

"You and Annabelle leave the backyard through the sliding glass door in the living room. Both of you head upstairs." 

me"Aight, see ya tomorrow!" 

a"Good night."

"You enter your room and flop onto the bed exhausted. You don't even bother turning off your lights."

"{i}Huh, who knew Annabelle was going through all that… Well at least she knows what she wants to do in life. They all have their goals. I guess I'm just… Eh, who cares. I'll let tomorrow's me worry about my future plans, right now I'm tired as-{/i}"
