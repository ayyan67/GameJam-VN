    me "Hey, I can help with that." 

    c "That’s great! But I don’t think you have any more snacks…" 

    me  "Chef said that he stays in the kitchen overnight, preparing ingredients for the following day." 

    c "I’d be down to ask him but he’s kinda hard to approach because he’s scary." 

    me "Don’t worry I’ll come with you." 

    c  "Oh, thank you so much!"

    "You and Cherry head downstairs. Both of you try to ignore Joffrey's corpse when passing the living room, but Cherry breaks down into tears." 

    c "Shit! I’m sorry… I just…" 

    me "It’s alright, let it out." 

    c "These types of things never dawned on me… Like just how fragile we are…" 

    me "…"

    c "Joffrey was alive just yesterday, he was rambling about his stupid investments and business. But now he’s lifeless… It’s just… I’m scared. I’ve never been more terrified of dying in my life. I don’t want to become that… I don’t want to be reduced to a lifeless bag of flesh…" 

    me "Someday, we’ll have to face it y’know. Hell, maybe when we get old and realize that we’ve lived a fulfilling life. Seeing your kids be successful and have kids of their own. Maybe then…" 

    c "I don’t think I’ll ever be able to accept death. I’d want to stay with my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren forever. There are so many things you’ll miss out on when you die. Maybe Joffrey’s business would have popped off and he could be more of an ass than he already is. But he can’t realize that reality anymore because he’s gone."

    "You knock on the kitchen door, and Chef's face appears behind the door window. It looks like he’s gone back to normal" 

    ch  "Lunch is in an hour. What do you rascals want?" 

    me "Cherry is worried that she’ll still be hungry after dinner so we’re wondering if snacks are in the pantry." 

    ch "We don’t have that kind of garbage here! I can fry up some potatoes but DO NOT EAT THEM BEFORE ANY OF THE MEALS I COOK YOU or so help me god I WILL ROAST YOU IN THE FUCKING OVEN."
 
    me and c "Yes, Chef!"

    "You and Cherry leave the Chef in the kitchen and head upstairs." 

    c "I’ll just nap for an hour to take my mind off of this whole situation for a bit." 

    me "Sounds good, take care ok." 

    c "I will." 

    "Time passes. Despite Chef still making four dishes for both lunch and dinner time, only you and Cherry are the ones that eat. Klaus is still in the wine cellar and Annabelle has yet to leave her room. After dinner, you take Annabelle’s plate of food with you and head upstairs." 

    # [SOUND: Knock Knock]

    me "Hey, Annabelle? Are you doing well there?" 

    "You are met with silence." 

    me "Um, you’ve been in your room for a while, so if you are hungry, I’ll just leave your plate out here."

    me "Y’know how we thought Chef was scary and all when we got here? I think he’s actually pretty nice. He still made four dishes for the four of us for both lunch and dinner! He’s thoughtful like that." 

    me "Or maybe he’s just happy when we eat his food, I don’t even know." 

    me "Listen… Uh… The whole thing with Joffrey… it turns out he was murdered… But don’t worry! I got that gut feeling that we’ll all be safe in the end and the culprit will get caught! We may be able to contact the police soon!"

    me "So… uh… yeah just stay in your room if you don’t feel safe, there’s food right outside if you are hungry. Um… Take care!"

    "{i}Huh, I’m still not tired yet. Annabelle’s cooped up in her room, Klaus is in the wine cellar and Cherry is probably enjoying her midnight snacks in her room. 
    I’ve got some time so maybe I’ll explore the mansion a bit.{/i}"
