 "You unlock the door to the surveillance room"

 "Breathing heavily, you shut the door behind you. You feel your heart beating out of your chest and your hands are trembling. The pain in your temples gets worse by the second. Your knees give up and you sink to the floor"

 "{i}Why- Why is this happening! Cherry- She’s dead! Klaus killed her! SHIT! WHY IS HE A MONSTER! {/i}"

 "Your eyes well up with tears as your vision begins to blur, you become aware of your surroundings. You’re in a dark room illuminated by the piercing glow of many monitors." 

 "The contrast in brightness burns your eyes. As your vision adjusts, your blue lips quiver as you notice the horror that befolds you" 

 j  "No, what the fuck! Get away fro-"

 "Joffrey, attempts to run up the stairs, falls and hits his chin"

 "Klaus grabs Joffrey by the leg, while Joffrey’s face contorts in terror and tears"
 
 "He then slams him onto the ground, spraying his blood on the floor"

 "Klaus picks up his ragged, bloody body and slams him again, spraying more blood everywhere"

 "He keeps going. And going. And going"

 "Deaf to Joffrey’s incessant screams for it to stop"

 "Eventually, the monitors fall silent"

 "What remained of Joffrey is now scattered across the Main Hall"

 m  "Enjoying the show?" 

 "Startled, you turn your back to the monitors to face the voice. Your hands waver over the desk for support. You feel something cold and hard brush past your palm. You glance over to your right hand and find a revolver"

 m  "You’ve never shot a gun before, have you. Unless-" 

 me  "Have you been watching us this entire time?! Did you do this to Klaus?!" 

 m  ".."

 me  "ANSWER ME!" 

 "In the next moment, you are shocked by a spine-chilling scream from the monitor" 

 "You shift your gaze to see Annabelle cornered in the guest room hallway" 

 "Backed up against the locked window, she’s trembling" 

 a  "Please, I don’t want to die! Not y-"

 "Klaus charges into her, splashing the window and walls with her innards " 

 "The sunlight that once shone into the hallway is now tinted crimson red." 

 m  "That’s everyone isn’t it?" 

 "You turn back to the maid" 

 "Your face is pale."

 "Your breathing is labored, it’s hard to breathe" 

 "You feel a sick acidity in the back of your throat, rising up to your nose" 

 me  "URGHHHH-"

 "Your vomit pools onto the floor" 

 m  "How unsightly. I’m the one who has to clean this up later you know" 

 "Your fear and anxiety turns your attention to the revolver"

        "{i}I… I have to get out of here. I can’t die yet.{/i}" 

        m "I see you’re going to be self-centered till the end."

        m "The idea of avenging those that were killed hasn’t crossed your mind, has it."

        me "I-"

        m "Rest assured. You performed well. This is the best outcome of your true nature." 

        m "I am satisfied with these results. So feel free to kill me whenever." 

        "Her nonchalance confuses and angers you."

        "Your face contorts in rage and you pull the trigger"

        "{i}B-but why is this happening…{/i}"

        "The curiosity of your situation gnaws at your head and quells your rage and confusion" 

        me "Wh-Why are you doing this…?"

        "Unbothered by the stinging stench of the vomit the maid answers unhesitatingly" 

        m "Humans all have a true nature. Whether or not they hide it from others or wear it on their sleeve does not matter." 

        m "Their intentions become most prevalent through the choices they make when faced against trial and tribulation." 

        me "...Wha-" 

        m "Let me explain, everyone has destined choices that align with your core self. As such, I have calculated the true natures of Klaus, Annabelle, Cherry, Joffrey and yourself." 

        m "I wanted to see if under these circumstances you could deviate from your respective predetermined routes." 

        me "What the hell-" 

        m "This is one of many trials. The experiment continues." 

        me "No- no way! We’re not your lab rats!"

        m "In this trial, Klaus was the manipulated variable." 

        me "We have our own free will!"

        m "The other subjects showed wonderful results. But you, however…"

        me "We aren’t slaves to fate!"

        m "Every human nature. Every human choice. It’s a series of computational numbers." 

        me "Hu-"

        m "Do not confuse useless euphemisms for computer data." 

        me "I- I don-"

        "{i}I don’t know what to say. Was everything I felt just a string of random calculations? Was my entire life…?{/i}" 

        m "Because you chose not to kill me, you are now going to kill yourself. I know you can't tell the truth of the world." 

        m "Well, no matter. There are usually no carry-overs in these events. In the next run, you will not remember anything from this interaction." 

        "{i}She thinks I’ll kill myself now? Is that part of all the whole calculations bullshit she was spewing?{/i}" 

        "You are enraged. You point the gun at her." 

        m "Oh, this is surprising." 

        "You lock eyes with her, filled with intent to put a bullet in her head." 

        me "I’m going to kill you. I’m going to escape and go back to my normal life." 

        m "..."

        me "I’m not going to listen to your bull-"

        "Your heart drops. And start to shake." 

        m "Why are you hesitating? Shoot me." 

        "Your entire life flashes before your eyes." 

        "Your parent’s faces."

        "Your school life." 

        "Your first love."

        "{i}Were my experiences all a simulation? Did I ever make a decision of my own?{/i}" 

        "You begin sweating. Your eyes fill with terror at the realization of how shallow everything had been." 

        m "Ah, it appears I got my hopes up." 

        "{i}I- I can’t take this anymore…{/i}"

        "You put the gun to your head."
