    me "Hey Annabelle? It's me [me], I'm coming in." 

    "You enter the room and close the door behind you. Her light is still on, but she remains under her sheets." 

    me "Cherry's hungry, so she's going to talk to the Chef. How are you feeling?" 

    a "..."

    "She peers from under her sheets."

    a "I'm fine..." 

    "She's quieter than before and her eyes are pretty swollen. The whole thing with Joffrey must have traumatized her."

    me "Have you eaten anything yet?" 

    a  "no"

    me "Are you not hungry? I'll tell Cherry to get some food for you as well-" 

    a  "No...! Don't..." 

    me "Well lunch is in an hour anyway. If you're still not feeling so well, I can ask Chef to bring your food here." 

    a "No...! It's fine... I'll eat when it's time..." 

    me "That's great." 

    "Neither you nor Annabelle say anything." 

    "{i}Crap. It's awkward now. Was I coming on too strong? I have no idea how to follow that. Should I leave? Maybe I'll call Cherry back or something. {/i}" 

    a "Ar... we... tra...?" 

    me "Pardon?" 

    a "Are we trapped...?" 

    me "I think the owner of the mansion wants to trap the murderer in so they don't get away before the police come." 

    a "Is there police coming...?" 

    me "Chef said that they are on their way, but they are going to get here really late for some reason. I don't know why." 

    a "..." 

    me "Don't worry, as long as we stick together, there won't be any more murders and eventually when the police come they can find out the culprit." 

    a "..." 

    me "Are you still anxious?" 

    a "No... I'm not... It's just..." 

    me "..."

    a "Everything is real... right?" 

    me "What do you mean?" 

    a "The suspicious email... nothing was false... even though it looked like a scam..." 

    me "yeah" 

    a "The money. Only one of us will be receiving it..."

    me "Are you saying that's a motive?" 

    a "Yes." 

    "{i}To be honest, I kind of forgot about the cash prize{/i}"

    a "I know... you're trying to get everyone to work together... but have you not considered that the killer... may be among us...?" 

    me "But-" 

    "{i} We don't really have the investigative expertise nor tools to find out who killed Joffrey. We only have alibis but none of them are confirmed by the others. Everyone was separated on the night Joffrey was killed. It-{/i}" 

    a "It all comes down to trust." 

    "You furrow your brows." 

    a "But are you really willing to trust the words of people you barely know...?" 

    me "Ok. Fine. If you want to start suspecting people, you should be OK with being suspected yourself."

    a "I am fine with that..." 

    "{i} Annabelle looks straight into your eyes. I'm prepared for that. {/i}"

    me "So, do you have an alibi?" 

    a "Whatever my alibi is... it doesn't matter. No one can confirm it. Just like everyone else's alibi." 

    me "..." 

    a  "The only thing that matters... is whether you trust me enough to believe I'm not a murderer." 

    me "..." 

    a "If you still suspect me, I'm a potential murderer in your eyes even if I told you the truth." 

    a "And if you trust Cherry... Even if she lied... You wouldn't suspect her at all..." 

    "{i}What the hell. Is this the same Annabelle? When did she become this provocative? Granted, nothing she said was wrong. If anything, I was naive with the whole stick together idea{/i}"

    me "Ok. You know what? You're right. I won't even ask you for your alibi. Because after everything you just said, I'm inclined to doubt everything that comes out of your mouth." 

    a "I don't want to trust someone playing detective. This... This is no game." 

    a "You are a suspect as well. Stop acting like the main character." 

    "{i}You look away but you can feel the piercing animosity from her gaze.{/i}"

    "{i}She's right. I was getting full of myself. I have nothing to say back to her.{/i}"

    "{i}You got up and walked out of Annabelle's room feeling defeated. {/i}"

    "{i}Time passes despite Chef making four dishes for lunch. Only you, Cherry and Annabelle eat lunch together. Annabelle later asks Maid to deliver her dinner to her room, so only you and Cherry eat dinner in the dining room. Klaus never left the wine cellar.{/i}"

    "{i}You bid good night to Cherry, but you aren't tired, so you decide to kill some time exploring the mansion. {/i}"
