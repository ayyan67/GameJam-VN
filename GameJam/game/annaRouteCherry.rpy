 c "SHHHHHH! come over, I have something to say."

 "You and Cherry secretly move to the corner of the kitchen."

 c "Please just believe me. I was just looking for food when..."

 c "I saw something in the pantry and then chef was yelling and threatening me with his knife. I didn’t mean to kill him"

 me"calm down, what do you mean by you didn’t mean to kill?"

 c "It’s an accident I swear I killed chef while acting in self-defence. There was a dead body in the pantry so chef must be a killer."

 me"There was a WHAT in the pantry?"

 c "It was pitch black but I definitely saw a body inside the pantry…"

 me"A DEAD BODY!? That’s impossible! We are the only ones in the mansion!"

 c "SHHHHHH! I swear it was in the pantry, I can prove it."

 "Walking towards the pantry, you and Cherry slowly slide open the pantry door anticipating the horror that might be behind it. But-"

 me"It’s empty. There’s no dead body, Cherry."

 c "I swear I saw it! There’s no way!"

 me"I’m trying to believe your story, but can you just tell me the truth. Why did you kill chef?"

 "In a blink of an eye, Cherry’s body is obliterated by a hulking mass of muscles - her innards splattering a cross you and into the hallway. A towering monster covered in blood stands before you."
