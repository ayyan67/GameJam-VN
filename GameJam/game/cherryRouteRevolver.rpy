    "You head out to the main hall in front of the living room. You hear the kitchen door open as the maid exits."

    "{i}Oh, it’s just the maid. It looks like she’s walking to the gaming room.{/i}"
    "{i}Maybe she’s good at pong or something. A quick game with her will probably take my mind off everything that’s been happening.{/i}"
    "{i}I don’t know anymore... I don’t want to doubt these people. There’s no way someone among us is capable of these acts - devoid of humanity.{/i}" 
    "{i}Joffrey may have been an ass, but nothing justifies his death nor how he was treated when he was killed. It’s inhuman. {/i}"

    "{i}You catch yourself feeling anxious again and remember that you wanted to play pong with Maid. {/i}"

    

    me "Hey Maid! Let’s play some-"

    {i} "But she is already out of your sight. You decide to follow her and head towards the game room. {/i}"

    me "Maid! Are you there?" 

    "{i}But the game room is empty. The silence is deafening. {/i}"

    "{i}Just yesterday, we were all having a wild time playing games here. But now. Joffrey is dead. And I’m forced to suspect everyone around me.{/i}"

    "{i}You grow dizzy. Your surroundings start to distort. Your paranoia heightens. {/i}"

    "{i}No one liked Joffrey after all. He harassed both Cherry and Annabelle. Klaus must have been tired of trying to keep him under control.{/i}"
    "{i}He disrespected Chef and his cooking. She may seem emotionless, but even Maid must’ve been pissed when he just dumped his bags on her and sexually harassed her.{/i}" 
    "{i}Everyone in this mansion had a motive to kill Joffrey. {/i}"

    "{i} A glint across the room catches your eye {/i}" 

    me "Huh. Is that-"

    "{i}A revolver. With this. With this, I can find the murderer. I have all the information I need. I’ll kill the murderer and save everyone. I can only trust myself. Yeah. It’s gotta be them. They definitely hated Joffrey the most. There’s no reason they wouldn’t kill him. {/i}" 

    "{i}The revolver is set on the ping pong table. You walk towards the table and check the chamber. {/i}"

    me "One bullet, huh. That’s all I need. I know who killed Joffrey. I’ll save everyone, just you wait."
